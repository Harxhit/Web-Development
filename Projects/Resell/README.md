# Resell & Share Platform

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This platform empowers users to **resell and share unused or partially used
goods and experiences** in a social, community-driven way. While it includes
**ticket reselling** (concerts, sports, travel, gaming, etc.), it also extends
to other scenarios like **sharing food orders, event passes, and group
experiences**.

Imagine you bought 10 concert tickets but two friends cancel last minute.
Instead of losing money, you can either:

- **Resell those tickets to others** at any price you set,
- Or **invite new people to join your group socially**, so no one misses out and
  everyone enjoys together.

Similarly, if you ordered a large pizza but canâ€™t finish it, you can **resell or
share slices** with others nearby who want some.
