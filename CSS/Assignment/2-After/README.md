# CSS ::after Pseudo-Element Exercises
This repository contains a series of exercises aimed at demonstrating various uses of the ::after pseudo-element in CSS. The goal is to explore the flexibility and power of ::after to add dynamic, decorative, and interactive elements to web designs.

## Assignment Overview
The exercises involve the following tasks:

### Decorative Underline for Headings:
- Create an ::after pseudo-element to add a long, colored line below a heading. The line should be centered and not stretch across the full width of the heading.

### Custom Tooltip on Hover:
- Use ::after to add a custom tooltip that appears when hovering over a button or link. Ensure the tooltip appears either above or below the element with a small arrow pointing toward it.

### Dynamic Notification Badge:
- Add a small circular badge with a number (e.g., "5") to a "Messages" or "Cart" button using ::after. Position the badge in the top-right corner of the button.

### Stylized Blockquotes:
- For a <blockquote> element, use ::after to add a decorative symbol (like a closing quotation mark ”) at the bottom-right corner of the blockquote. Adjust the size, position, and color for a modern design.

### Breadcrumb Navigation Separator:
- In a breadcrumb navigation menu (Home > Products > Electronics), use ::after to dynamically add the ">" symbol between each breadcrumb item, but not after the last item.

### Hover Animation with Arrow:
- Add an arrow (→) using ::after that appears and slides into view when hovering over a link. Control its starting position, speed, and final placement for smooth animation.


### Loading Dots Animation:
- Create a button or text (e.g., "Loading") and use ::after to add three dots (...) that animate in a looping fashion (one dot appears at a time).

## Instructions
- Complete each exercise using the ::after pseudo-element to achieve the desired effect.
- Experiment with different values and styles to customize the appearance and behavior of each element.
## Files
The project consists of HTML and CSS files where the exercises can be implemented.
