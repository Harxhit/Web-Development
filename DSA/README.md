# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Practice

Welcome to the **DSA Practice** repository! This folder contains a collection of problems designed to help you practice and master the core concepts of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using **JavaScript**.

## Contents

This repository covers a wide range of topics related to DSA, organized by difficulty levels. The topics include:

- **Arrays**
- **Strings**
- **Loops and Conditions**
- **Objects**
- **Sorting Algorithms**
- **Search Algorithms**
- **Recursion**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Greedy Algorithms**
- **Graph Algorithms**
- **Backtracking**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Stacks and Queues**
- **Trees and Binary Trees**
- **Heaps**
- **Hashing**

Each topic is explained with a problem and its corresponding solution, where applicable.

### Problem Categories

The problems are organized into three main categories based on difficulty level and each cateogry have 50 questions each .

1. **Basic**: Fundamental problems that focus on understanding and implementing basic data structures and algorithms.
2. **Medium**: Problems that require a deeper understanding of DSA concepts and the ability to apply algorithms to solve moderately complex problems.
3. **Hard**: Advanced problems that test your ability to work with complex algorithms and data structures, often requiring optimization techniques and an understanding of time and space complexity.

### Topics Covered

1. **Arrays & Strings**

   - Sorting, searching, reversing, and manipulating arrays.
   - Solving common string manipulation problems.

2. **Loops & Conditions**

   - Writing loops and handling conditional statements to control the flow of the program.

3. **Objects & Data Structures**

   - Implementing and using objects, hashmaps, sets, and other data structures.

4. **Algorithms**

   - Sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, etc.
   - Searching algorithms: Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.
   - Dynamic Programming (DP): Solving problems using memoization or tabulation.
   - Recursion: Using recursion to solve problems and break them down into smaller sub-problems.
   - Backtracking: Solving problems by exploring all possibilities and choosing the best solution.
   - Greedy Algorithms: Making locally optimal choices to find the global optimum.

5. **Advanced Data Structures**
   - Linked Lists: Singly and doubly linked lists.
   - Stacks and Queues: Implementing stack and queue operations.
   - Trees: Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, and tree traversals.
   - Graphs: BFS, DFS, Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, and more.
