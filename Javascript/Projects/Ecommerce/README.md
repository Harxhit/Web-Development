## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Make sure you have all images placed correctly inside `/assests/images/`.
3. Make sure Tailwind CSS is properly linked through `/tailwind/public/style.css`.
4. Make sure JavaScript is properly linked through `/javascript/Projects/Ecommerce/script.js`.
5. Open `index.html` in any browser.

## Notes

- Ensure the correct file paths, especially for the images, CSS, and JS files.  
  (`/assests/` seems like a typo — it should be `/assets/`.)
- You can customize product details easily inside the `index.html` file.
- Tailwind CSS needs to be properly installed if you're adding more customizations.

## Future Improvements

- Add quantity adjustment (increase/decrease products)
- Remove items from cart
- Add a simple checkout form
- Connect to a backend for real orders
- Add animations for better user experience
