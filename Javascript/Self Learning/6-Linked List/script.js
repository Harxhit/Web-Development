/* 
LinkedList is the dynamic data structure, as we can add or remove elements at ease, and it can even grow as needed. Just like arrays, linked lists store elements sequentially, but donâ€™t store the elements contiguously like an array. In a linked list we can only move left to right , we cannot move reverse in linked list .
