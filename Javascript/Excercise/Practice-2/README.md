# Exercise on Array:

**Question 1**
Declare an array named `teaFlavors` that contains the strings `"green tea"`, `"black tea"`, and `"oolong tea"`. Access the first element of the array and store it in a variable named `firstTea`.

**Question 2**
Declare an array named `cities` containing `"London"`, `"Tokyo"`, `"Paris"`, and `"New York"`. Access the third element in the array and store it in a variable named `favoriteCity`.

**Question 3**
You have an array named `teaTypes` containing `"herbal tea"`, `"white tea"`, and `"masala chai"`. Change the second element of the array to `"jasmine tea"`.

**Question 4**
Declare an array named `citiesVisited` containing `"Mumbai"` and `"Sydney"`. Add `"Berlin"` to the array using the `push` method.

**Question 5**
You have an array named `teaOrders` with `"chai"`, `"iced tea"`, `"matcha"`, and `"earl grey"`. Remove the last element of the array using the `pop` method and store it in a variable named `lastOrder`.

**Question 6**
You have an array named `popularTeas` containing `"green tea"`, `"oolong tea"`, and `"chai"`. Create a soft copy of this array named `softCopyTeas`.

**Question 7**
You have an array named `topCities` containing `"Berlin"`, `"Singapore"`, and `"New York"`. Create a hard copy of this array named `hardCopyCities`.

**Question 8**
You have two arrays: `europeanCities` containing `"Paris"` and `"Rome"`, and `asianCities` containing `"Tokyo"` and `"Bangkok"`. Merge these two arrays into a new array named `worldCities`.

**Question 9**
You have an array named `teaMenu` containing `"masala chai"`, `"oolong tea"`, `"green tea"`, and `"earl grey"`. Find the length of the array and store it in a variable named `menuLength`.
