# Conditional Statements and Operations

This repository contains JavaScript exercises designed to practice working with conditional statements, arrays, and other basic JavaScript concepts. The exercises include various use cases like checking if a number is positive or negative, calculating the largest number, checking eligibility for voting, assigning grades to students, and more.

## Exercises

### **Question 1**

Write a program to check if a number is positive or negative.

### **Question 2**

Determine whether a given number is even or odd.

### **Question 3**

Find the largest of two numbers and handle the case when they are equal.

### **Question 4**

Check if a person is eligible to vote based on their age.

### **Question 5**

Verify if a number is within the range of 10 to 20.

### **Question 6**

Check if a given string is empty or not.

### **Question 7**

Assign a grade to a student based on their marks (A, B, C, or F).

### **Question 8**

Write a program to check if a year is a leap year.

### **Question 9**

Identify the type of a triangle (Equilateral, Isosceles, or Scalene) based on side lengths.

## Objectives

- Understand and practice **conditional statements** (if-else, else-if, and ternary operators).
- Learn to apply logical operators like `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), and comparison operators like `==`, `===`, `<`, `>`, etc.
- Practice handling multiple conditions and applying them to real-world problems.
- Understand and implement JavaScript concepts like **variable declaration**, **initialization**, and **data manipulation**.

## Key Concepts Reinforced

- **Conditional statements**: Using `if`, `else if`, `else` to make decisions based on conditions.
- **Comparison operators**: Using operators like `==`, `===`, `>`, `<`, `!=`, `>=`, `<=` to compare values.
