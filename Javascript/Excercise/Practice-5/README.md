# JavaScript Class Implementations

This repository contains implementations of various JavaScript classes that demonstrate object-oriented programming concepts, such as classes, inheritance, methods, and property handling. Below is a list of the classes and their functionalities:

## 1. Person Class

This class introduces basic class structure, including properties and methods, and uses the constructor to initialize object properties.

## 2. Car Class

This class demonstrates managing multiple properties and accessing them with a method. It teaches handling multiple class attributes.

## 3. Student Class

This class demonstrates inheritance by extending the `Person` class. It teaches how to create a subclass and add additional methods specific to that subclass.

## 4. BankAccount Class

This class teaches how to manage state within a class. It introduces methods that modify the state of the object (like deposit and withdrawal operations) and track the balance.

## 5. Rectangle Class

This class shows how to handle geometric shapes, focusing on using properties like `length` and `width` to perform calculations (area and perimeter).

## 6. Animal Class

The `Animal` class introduces polymorphism. It has a method (`speak()`) that gets overridden in its subclasses (`Dog` and `Cat`) to demonstrate behavior-specific changes in subclasses.

## 7. Circle Class

This class focuses on defining a specific geometric shape (circle) and using its properties (radius) in methods for calculations.

## 8. Employee Class

This class teaches how to manage properties like `name`, `id`, and `salary` and implement methods to display information about the object.

## 9. Book Class

This class introduces how to apply a business rule (like applying a discount) to an object by modifying its properties with a method.

## 10. Shape Class

This class teaches abstract behavior where methods (like `getArea()`) are defined in a parent class and overridden by child classes (`Square`, `Triangle`) to implement shape-specific logic.

## 11. Teacher Class

This class extends the `Person` class and demonstrates method overriding to modify inherited behavior.

## 12. Movie Class

This class demonstrates how to structure data related to movies (`title`, `director`, `year`) and provides a method to return movie details.

## 13. Library Class

This class teaches how to manage collections of objects (books). It shows how to implement methods for adding, removing, and displaying items in an array.

## 14. Item Class

This class focuses on properties like `name` and `price` and how to implement a method to calculate the total price after applying tax.

## 15. Counter Class

This class introduces the concept of modifying internal state using methods like `increment()` and `decrement()`, while also providing a method to access the current state (`getCount()`).
