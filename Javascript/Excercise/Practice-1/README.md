# Practice Problems in JavaScript

This project is a collection of beginner-level JavaScript practice problems. The problems are designed to help reinforce foundational concepts, such as working with variables, arrays, objects, and basic data types. Below is an overview of the tasks included in this practice:

## Questions Overview

### 1. Variables and Data Types

- Create variables for different data types: **number**, **string**, **boolean**, **undefined**, and **null**.
- Print the values of these variables.

### 2. Type Checking

- Use the `typeof` operator to determine the data type of a variable.

### 3. Arrays

- Create an array of colors and perform the following operations:
  - Access and print the third color in the array.
  - Add a new color to the end of the array using the `push` method and print the updated array.
  - Remove the first color from the array using the `shift` method and print the updated array.
- Create an array of numbers and calculate their total (manually, without a loop).

### 4. Objects

- Create an object to represent a book with properties like `title`, `author`, and `pages`.
- Update the `pages` property of the object to a new value and print the updated object.
- Add a new property `genre` to the object and set its value.

### 5. Type Checking for Arrays and Objects

- Create an array and an object, then use the `typeof` operator to determine their types.

## Objectives

- Understand and practice variable declaration and initialization.
- Work with basic data types in JavaScript.
- Perform common operations on arrays, such as adding, removing, and accessing elements.
- Learn to create and manipulate objects.
- Practice checking data types using `typeof`.

## Key Concepts Reinforced
- JavaScript data types: **string**, **number**, **boolean**, **undefined**, **null**.
- Array manipulation using methods like `push` and `shift`.
- Object creation and property updates.
- Basic type checking using `typeof`.
