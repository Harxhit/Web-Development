# DOM Manipulation Examples

This project demonstrates various DOM manipulation techniques using JavaScript. The examples cover a wide range of topics, from basic DOM element access to event handling and form submission. Each section demonstrates how to interact with the DOM using methods like `getElementById`, `createElement`, `addEventListener`, and more.

## Key Learnings

### 1. **Accessing DOM Elements**
   - Using `getElementById` to access specific elements by their ID.
   - Manipulating content of an element by changing its inner text.

### 2. **Traversing the DOM**
   - Accessing and modifying sibling elements and changing the style of elements using JavaScript.
   - Example: Highlighting the first city in a list.

### 3. **Manipulating DOM Elements**
   - Changing text content of an element dynamically using JavaScript.
   - Example: Changing the order of a beverage from "Latte" to "Espresso".

### 4. **Creating and Inserting Elements**
   - Dynamically creating new elements using `createElement`.
   - Appending newly created elements to existing ones using `appendChild`.
   - Example: Adding a new item to a shopping list.

### 5. **Removing DOM Elements**
   - Removing an element from the DOM using `removeChild`.
   - Example: Removing the last item from a task list.

### 6. **Event Handling in the DOM**
   - Handling user events such as button clicks with `addEventListener`.
   - Example: A button click that triggers a function to perform some action.

### 7. **Event Delegation**
   - Using event delegation to handle events on multiple child elements dynamically by listening on the parent.
   - Example: Clicking on any list item to select a tea type.

### 8. **Form Handling**
   - Handling form input and displaying the input data after form submission.
   - Example: Submitting feedback through a form and displaying the entered feedback.

### 9. **DOM Content Loaded**
   - Using the `DOMContentLoaded` event to ensure that the DOM is fully loaded before manipulating it.

### 10. **CSS Classes Manipulation**
   - Toggling CSS classes using JavaScript to change styles dynamically.
   - Example: Toggling a highlighted class on text to change its background color.

## Key DOM Methods & Concepts Covered:
   - `getElementById()`
   - `createElement()`
   - `appendChild()`
   - `removeChild()`
   - `addEventListener()`
   - `classList.toggle()`
   - Event handling and delegation
   - Form handling and input validation

## How to Use the Code

1. Clone or download the project.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Explore each section to see how DOM manipulation techniques are applied.
4. Interact with the buttons to observe different changes to the DOM in action.

## Conclusion

Through this exercise, you will learn how to effectively interact with the DOM, manipulate elements, handle user input, and work with events in JavaScript. These are essential skills for building dynamic and interactive web pages.
