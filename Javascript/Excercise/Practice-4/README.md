# Loop Exercises in JavaScript

This repository contains JavaScript exercises designed to practice working with **loops**, **arrays**, and other basic JavaScript concepts. The exercises cover various types of loops (for loop, while loop) to help solidify the understanding of iterative processes in JavaScript.

## Exercises

The following are the exercises included in this repository:

### **Question 1**:

Write a for loop that prints the squares of numbers from 1 to 5.

### **Question 2**:

Write a while loop that prints numbers from 10 to 1 in reverse order.

### **Question 3**:

Write a program using a loop that sums up all the even numbers between 1 and 20.

### **Question 4**:

Write a for loop that iterates through a list of strings and prints each string in uppercase.

### **Question 5**:

Write a while loop that prompts the user for input until they type "exit".

### **Question 6**:

Write a program using a loop that counts how many vowels are in a given string.

### **Question 7**:

Write a program that finds the factorial of a number using a for loop.

### **Question 8**:

Write a program that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to the 20th term using a loop.

### **Question 9**:

Write a for loop that prints the sum of all odd numbers in a list of integers.

### **Question 10**:

Write a program that reverses a given string using a loop.

### **Question 11**:

Write a program that prints a multiplication table for a given number using a loop.

### **Question 12**:

Write a program to generate all prime numbers up to 100 using a loop.

### **Question 13**:

Write a program that uses nested loops to print a pattern (e.g., a triangle of stars).

### **Question 14**:

Write a program to find the largest number in a list of numbers using a loop.

### **Question 15**:

Write a program that takes a list of numbers and counts how many numbers are divisible by 3 using a loop.

### **Question 16**:

Write a program to merge two sorted lists into one sorted list using a loop.

### **Question 17**:

Write a program that implements a "guess the number" game using loops and conditions.

### **Question 18**:

Write a program to calculate the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of two numbers using a loop.

### **Question 19**:

Write a program to find all pairs of numbers in a list whose sum is equal to a target value using loops.

### **Question 20**:

Write a program that prints Pascal's Triangle for a given number of rows using nested loops.

## Objectives

- **Understand and practice loops**: (for loop, while loop, and nested loops).
- **Master how to iterate over arrays** and handle multiple iterations efficiently.
- **Apply loops to real-world problems** and use loops for mathematical calculations, string manipulation, and pattern creation.
- **Learn and practice other JavaScript concepts** like **array manipulation**, **data types**, and **conditional statements** in combination with loops.

## Key Concepts Reinforced

- **For Loops**: Using for loops to iterate over arrays, ranges, or specific values.
- **While Loops**: Applying while loops for conditions where the number of iterations is not predefined.
- **Nested Loops**: Using nested loops to solve problems that require multiple levels of iteration (e.g., generating patterns, multi-dimensional arrays).
- **Iteration over Arrays**: Looping through array elements and performing actions on them.
- **Mathematical Operations**: Using loops to calculate sums, factorials, Fibonacci sequences, and prime numbers.
- **String Manipulation**: Using loops to reverse strings, count vowels, and convert characters.

## How to Run

To run the JavaScript exercises:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
