# Node.js Learning Journey

Welcome to my Node.js learning ! This project is dedicated to tracking my progress as I learn Node.js, a powerful JavaScript runtime that allows me to build server-side applications. In this repository, I'll explore key concepts, work on projects, and document everything I learn along the way.

## Why Node.js?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows for building scalable network applications and server-side services using JavaScript. As a beginner, it offers the advantage of using the same language on both the client and server side, making the development process easier.

## Learning Goals

- Understand the basics of Node.js
- Learn how to set up a Node.js project and manage dependencies with `npm`
- Develop server-side applications with Express.js
- Work with databases (both SQL and NoSQL)
- Build RESTful APIs
- Explore asynchronous programming with callbacks, promises, and async/await
- Learn about file system interactions
- Implement error handling and logging
- Understand testing and debugging practices in Node.js
