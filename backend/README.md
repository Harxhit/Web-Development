# Backend Development with Node.js

Welcome to my **Backend Development Journey using Node.js**. This repository documents my progress in mastering backend engineering using Node.js, a powerful and efficient JavaScript runtime environment. My focus will be on building scalable server-side applications, RESTful APIs, database integrations, and production-ready services.

## Why Backend with Node.js?

Node.js is built on Chrome's V8 engine and is designed to build high-performance, scalable network applications. Its non-blocking, event-driven architecture makes it ideal for backend services such as APIs, authentication systems, and real-time apps. Using JavaScript end-to-end also improves productivity and learning speed.

## Backend Goals

- Build scalable RESTful APIs
- Understand and implement Express.js framework
- Perform CRUD operations with SQL and NoSQL databases
- Implement authentication and authorization (JWT)
- Handle asynchronous operations effectively
- Secure backend applications
- Write unit tests and debug backend code
- Learn to deploy backend applications

---

## Core Topics

### 1. Node.js Backend Fundamentals

- Node.js runtime, Event Loop & architecture
- Core modules (`http`, `fs`, `path`, `os`, `events`)
- CommonJS vs ES Modules
- Setting up Node.js backend projects

### 2. npm and Project Structure

- `npm init` and package management
- Organize code using modules and MVC pattern
- Use environment variables with `dotenv`
- Running scripts with `nodemon`

### 3. Express.js Framework

- Creating and configuring Express apps
- Middleware (built-in, custom, third-party)
- RESTful routing
- Error-handling middleware
- Serving static files

### 4. RESTful API Development

- REST principles and route design
- CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Route parameters and query strings
- Request/response lifecycle

### 5. Databases Integration

- SQL vs NoSQL comparison
- Using MongoDB with Mongoose
- Connecting to MySQL/PostgreSQL
- Data modeling and relationships

### 6. Authentication and Authorization

- User registration and login flow
- Hashing passwords with `bcrypt`
- Generating tokens with `jsonwebtoken` (JWT)
- Middleware for protected routes

### 7. File System & Streams

- Reading/writing files using the `fs` module
- File uploads (with `multer`)
- Working with streams for performance

### 8. Testing and Debugging

- Writing unit and integration tests with `Mocha`, `Chai`, or `Jest`
- Using `debugger`, `console.log`, and `node inspect`
- Error handling best practices

### 9. Security Best Practices

- Securing Express apps with `helmet`, `cors`, `rate-limit`
- Validating input with `Joi` or `express-validator`
- Preventing XSS and SQL Injection
- HTTPS setup

### 10. Deployment

- Hosting apps on Heroku, Vercel, Render, or AWS
- Using `pm2` and reverse proxies like Nginx
- CI/CD basics
- Managing `.env` variables in production
